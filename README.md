# Project Information

- **Main Author:** Jagroop10

I am thrilled to share with you my latest portfolio website that showcases my web development skills and experience using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GSAP, and Baffle scripts. The website is designed to be minimalistic, modern, and user-friendly, with smooth animations and interactions to keep visitors engaged.

The website's color palette and typography are kept simple and elegant, emphasizing the website's purpose of showcasing my work. The website's design is fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and devices for a seamless user experience.

I used JavaScript to create custom animations and interactions that add an extra layer of engagement and interactivity to the website. I also utilized GSAP, an animation library, to create smooth animations for elements such as text, images, and icons. Additionally, I incorporated the Baffle script to create an animated text effect that adds a unique touch to the website.

To ensure the website looks professional and modern, I implemented various design elements such as custom icons, hover effects, and a clean navigation bar. These design elements make the website easy to navigate and enhance the user experience.

Overall, I am proud of how this project turned out and believe it represents my skills and experience as a web developer. I look forward to using this portfolio website to showcase my work to potential clients and employers and continuing to improve and refine it over time.
