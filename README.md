# Project Information

- **Main Author:** Jagroop10

I am excited to introduce my latest project - a minimalistic portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The primary goal of this website is to showcase my web development skills and experience in a modern and clean design. I focused on making the website easy to navigate and aesthetically pleasing, with smooth control and interactions.

To achieve this, I used a minimalist color palette and typography, creating a simple and elegant layout that highlights my projects and skills. The website is fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices, and ensuring a smooth user experience.

One of the key features of this website is its use of JavaScript to create smooth animations and interactions, adding an extra level of interactivity and engagement. I also incorporated various design elements such as custom icons, hover effects, and a clean navigation bar to make the website look modern and professional.

Overall, I am proud of how this project turned out and believe it accurately represents my skills and experience as a web developer. I look forward to using this portfolio website to showcase my work to potential clients and employers, and I am excited to continue refining and improving it over time.
